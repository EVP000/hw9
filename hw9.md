Emmy Pahmer, Homework week 9 Clustering 17-NOV-2019

Pseudo code of the process -Choose 3 random points, centroids -For the
data points, measure the distance between the point itself and the
centroids -If a point is closest to that centroid, it is considered to
be part of that group -the centroid is recalculated as the mid-point of
all the points in the cluser, including that new point. -distances from
the centroids are recalculated -repeat until data points no longer move
from one cluster to another and centroids no longer move -perform this
several times with different starting centroids, until the sum of
variation is as low as possible -assign a label to the members of each
cluster
